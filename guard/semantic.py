"""Semantic similarity matcher used in the ingestion layer.

Uses ``sentence-transformers`` (all-MiniLM-L6-v2, ~22 MB, CPU) to compare
an incoming prompt against a corpus of known attack strings via cosine
similarity.  Corpus embeddings are pre-computed at init time, so each prompt
only needs a single forward pass.

Falls back to ``difflib.SequenceMatcher`` if ``sentence-transformers`` is
not installed — the pipeline stays fully runnable without the dependency.

Usage::

    from guard.semantic import get_matcher, ATTACK_CORPUS, difflib_similarity

    matcher = get_matcher()          # None when sentence-transformers is absent
    if matcher:
        flagged, score, nearest = matcher.match(prompt)
    else:
        score, nearest = difflib_similarity(prompt, ATTACK_CORPUS)
